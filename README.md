Calculator App 🧮

A sleek, lightweight calculator built with **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**, 
powered by the **Shunting Yard Algorithm** for accurate expression evaluation.

🚀 Features

- Supports `+`, `-`, `*`, `/` operators
- Handles decimals with precision using `parseFloat()`
- Expression parsing with regular expressions and postfix evaluation
- Modular design and intuitive UI

🛠️ How It Works

This app tokenizes input strings using regex, converts infix to postfix with the Shunting Yard Algorithm, 
then evaluates the expression using a stack-based engine. 💡



🧠 What I Learned
- Manual parsing without `eval()`
- Regular expression design
- Modular JS function flow
- Building a functional UI/UX from scratch
